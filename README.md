# Blogchain


Blogchain is a platform, Where bloggers can publish their blocks on the ethereum blockchain and get rewarded by readers sending them ether.


# What do we do!

Ownership, immutablity and reward, is what we deliver.

As a reader you can navigate all blogs, search by keyword or blogger adderss and when ever you feel rich and generous, you can buy a blogger a cup of coffee to keep crafting awesome blogs.
Cup of coffee = sending 1 Ether to blogger

As a Blogger, post you great blogs and wait for readers feedback, a feedback in ether $_$
