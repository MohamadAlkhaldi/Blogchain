# Blogchain


Blogchain is a platform, Where bloggers can publish their blocks on the ethereum blockchain and get rewarded by readers sending them ether.


## What do we do!

Ownership, immutablity and reward, is what we deliver.

As a reader you can navigate all blogs, search by keyword or blogger adderss and when ever you feel rich and generous, you can buy a blogger a cup of coffee to keep crafting awesome blogs.
Cup of coffee = sending 1 Ether to blogger

As a Blogger, post your great blogs and wait for readers feedback, a feedback in ether $_$

check out some of our users stories:

> Always hated being forced to pay for 
low quality articles, with blogchain I only  
support when sense great effort and   
a worthy blogger.  
        - Mark, reader


> I post my blogs on blogchain for two reasons:  
1- I am done with my content getting robbed,  
now my blogs are safe and sound on the Ethereum blockchain  
2- A reader can buy a cup of coffee with  
one click, THE POWER OF CRYPTO BABYYY!  
        - Khaled, blogger

- Metamask

```

In a seperate terminal window

```

Start front end server:
```sh
$ cd client
$ npm install
$ cd node_modules/websocket install

$ cd ../..

```

### Use Case

1- Create a blog using account 1, confirm transaction on Metamask  
2- Switch to account 2, **because a blogger can't reward himself**
